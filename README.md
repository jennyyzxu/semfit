# semfit

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of semfit is to extract structural equation modeling (SEM)
information, including model type, fit indices, and descriptive language
of model fit from academic papers. Users who donâ€™t have any background
in SEM could use this package as a starting point in coding complicated
paragraphs through simple copy paste. This package contributes to an
ongoing research project examining SEM practices in applied social
sciences.

## Installation

You can install the development version of semfit from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jennyyzxu/semfit")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(semfit)
## basic example code
paragraph <- "We conducted multi-level structural equation modeling (ML-SEM) with the R package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) to test our hypotheses, with all views on aging indicators loaded on a latent variable (i.e., negative views on aging)."

extract_fit(paragraph)
#> $model_type
#> [1] "SEM"    "ML-SEM"
#> 
#> $fit_indices
#> [1] "No fit indices found"
#> 
#> $description
#> [1] "No descriptive language found"
```
